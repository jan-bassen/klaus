# TODO

# Agents
- [ ] Fitness - An agent that tracks my fitness goals/progress, manage my trainingplan and helps me stay on track. I want to call him directly with @fitness during training sessions and he should be able to provide me with motivation and insights, mostly through random (for me unexpected) dispatches to motivate me. Espescially on training days.
- [ ] Daily - An agent that runs every day in the morning to create a daily report in the daily note of the obsidian vault and a short voice message (in german). The daily report should include the weather, the most important few news (local, national, global), a quick check of one or two science news websites. 

## Skills
- [x] Add a new primitive for dynamically loaded md content
- [x] Add a new core tool for retrieving said skills
- [x] Expose `{{skills}}` Handlebars var so agents can frame their available skills in the prompt

## Evals
- [ ] Add `*.eval.ts` files for non-deterministic behavior (pipeline end-to-end, agent tool selection, memory search relevance)
- [ ] See `AGENT.md` for eval conventions
